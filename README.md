## 1. What is a _recommendation system_ and how does it work?

**Recommendation Systems** are tools to assist users in filtering through the avalanche of available content and making personalized, informed choices, such as what movie to watch, which product to buy, or where to dine. 

### Paradigms

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Based on user behavior or preferences. This includes user-to-user and item-to-item approaches.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Matches items to a user profile based on attributes.
3. **Hybrid Models**: Combine the strengths of Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering.

### Core Algorithms

#### Memory-Based vs Model-Based

- **Memory-Based**: Rely directly on the user-item interaction data.
  - **User-Item Filtering**: Also called the "item-item collaborative filter," it focuses on the items that are most relevant to a particular user and then finds users who are similar to that user based on their rated items to recommend other items that those users have liked.
  - **Item-Item Filtering**: Also called the "user-user collaborative filter," it focuses on users who have similar preferences to a particular user and then uses their ratings on items that the current user hasn't yet rated to generate recommendations.
- **Model-Based**: Filter data through machine learning models.

#### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

SVD primarily focuses on **Matrix Factorization** and is especially well-suited for datasets that have a large number of dimensions or contain many missing elements. It can handle highly sparse data.

In the context of recommendation systems, SVD is employed to predict a user's rating for an item that they haven't rated yet. This prediction is then used to fulfill two major desires:

- **Rating Prediction**: Predict a user's rating for a certain item.
- **Top-N Recommendations**: Identify the best N items for a user, where "best" could mean items the user is most likely to rate highly or enjoy.

SVD factorizes the original user-item matrix into three constituent matrices, which, when multiplied together, approximate the original matrix as closely as possible:

$$
A_{m \times n} \approx U_{m \times r} \cdot S_{r \times r} \cdot V^T_{r \times n}
$$

Here $U$, $S$, and $V$ stand for User, Singular Values, and Item matrices, respectively. $m$ is the number of users, $n$ is the number of items, and $r$ is the number of reduced latent dimensions.

The SVD model exposes these latent factors, often called "embeddings," which can capture the inherent **structure and patterns** in the dataset, facilitating the generation of accurate recommendations.

### Operational Advantages

- **Scalability**: SVD can handle large, sparsely populated datasets adeptly.
- **Sparsity Handling**: It is able to manage datasets where a substantial number of user-item interactions are missing or unobserved.

### Performance Considerations

-  **Data Quality**: While having missing values could make SVD more robust, noisy data can hinder its efficacy.
-  **Cold Start**: SVD might struggle when new users or items without sufficient historical data are introduced.
-  **Dynamic Data**: Its strategy could become less effective when user preferences or item attributes evolve rapidly.

### When to Apply SVD

- **Recommendation Use-Case**: Ideal for generic item recommendations rather than niche content.

- **Sparse Datasets**: When user-item interaction data is mostly absent, rendering the dataset sparse, SVD's ability to manage such data adds to its utility.
<br>

## 2. Can you explain the difference between _collaborative filtering_ and _content-based recommendations_?

Both **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Recommendations** are widely used in recommendation systems, each with its unique approach.

### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative Filtering models infer patterns from user-item interaction matrices, such as movie ratings (utility matrices). It then uses these patterns to make predictions.

- **Memory-Based**: Also known as $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN), it recommends items based on similarity measures such as Pearson correlation. These measures might be user-based or item-based.
  
- **Model-Based**: Employs machine learning algorithms like Matrix Factorization for denser and more complex datasets. Latent factors (hidden features) are inferred to better represent users and items.

### Content-Based Recommendations

Content-Based Filtering leverages meta-information or content characteristics attributed to users and items.

- **Vector Space Model**: Transforms textual data into vector representations using techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Cosine similarity then computes the likeness between a user's profile and items.

- **Machine Learning Approaches**: Utilizes traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines) to construct models that are tailored to specific user preferences.

### Hybrid Systems

To benefit from the strengths of both filtering methods, many recommendation systems use a hybrid approach, combining collaborative and content-based techniques. These fusion systems can be:

- **Feature Level**: They merge features extracted from content-based and collaborative filtering models.
- **Model Level**: They assemble core models from collaborative and content-based systems.

Hybrid techniques aim to form a unified recommendation that minimizes the drawbacks of individual techniques, providing more accurate and versatile recommendations.
<br>

## 3. What are the main _challenges_ in building _recommendation systems_?

Building **recommendation systems** comes with its **unique set of challenges**, requiring strategies that balance complexity and user experience.

### Challenges

#### Cold Start

Initiating recommendations for a new user or a new item poses a challenge. Without historical data, it's difficult to understand a user's preferences or an item's properties.

- **User Cold Start**: When a new user joins, the system lacks information about their preferences or behavior.
- **Item Cold Start**: With a new item, there's a lack of data regarding how users interact with or perceive it.

#### Sparsity

In datasets, user-item interactions are often sparse, meaning that users tend to interact with only a small subset of available items.

When this occurs, the challenge is to generate accurate and relevant suggestions despite a limited amount of data.

#### Scalability

As user bases and item catalogs grow, the number of possible recommendations increases rapidly. This can affect both computational and storage requirements, making it challenging for a system to adapt and scale effectively.

#### Real-Time Updates

Recommendation systems should accommodate real-time updates to ensure the most relevant and up-to-date suggestions. This becomes challenging, especially in environments where data streams in continuously, such as in social media or e-commerce.

#### Multistakeholder Management

In scenarios with multiple stakeholders like users, advertisers, and content creators, the system needs to strike a delicate balance to ensure fair and effective recommendations that cater to the diverse needs of each group.

#### Unprecedented Events

The occurrence of unseen or rare events, such as the sudden popularity of a new item or changes in user preferences, can swiftly alter the system's dynamics.

Ensuring the system adapts to such fluctuations and doesn't become too reliant on historical data or prior assumptions is a formidable challenge.

#### Fairness and Bias

Recommendations should be fair and unbiased, taking into account diversity and achieving a balance between popular and niche items.

Additionally, a system should not inadvertently promote or exclude specific groups or content based on sensitive attributes like race or gender.

#### Interpretability 

Transparency and the ability to explain the underlying reasons for a recommendation are crucial, especially in regulated domains.

Balancing interpretability with the often complex and personalized nature of recommendations poses a significant challenge.

### Focal Points for Improvement 

While not ignoring the overall challenges, here are some specific approaches to improve the three aspects:

#### Data Quality and Quantity

Strategies focusing on enhancing data quality and managing data sparsity contribute to more effective recommendations.

- **Incentivization and Data Collection Strategies**: Encouraging users to provide more explicit feedback on items can help mitigate sparsity.
- **Consideration of Contextual Information**: Incorporating additional information about users or items, such as location or time of day, can help in situations with sparse data.
- **Active Sampling**: This involves identifying and obtaining data from often underrepresented regions of the user-item interaction matrix to reduce sparsity.

#### Algorithmic Advancements 

Refining recommendation algorithms yields better quality suggestions. 

- **Ensemble Methods and Hybrid Approaches**: Combining multiple algorithms or data sources often results in superior predictions.
- **Regularization Techniques**: These methods help prevent overfitting, reducing both noise and bias in recommendations.
- **Deep Learning and Neural Networks**: Advanced models such as neural collaborative filtering can capture intricate user-item interactions, offering a more granular understanding of preferences.

#### User Experience

Enhancing the user experience to ensure guidance and respect for users' autonomy is pivotal.

- **Fairness-Aware Models**: These are designed explicitly to mitigate bias in recommendations, ensuring fair and diverse suggestions across user segments.
- **Explainable AI**: Systems designed to provide explanations for recommendations not only build user trust but also assist in addressing fairness concerns.
- **Multi-Criteria Recommendations**: Rather than focusing solely on relevance, these systems consider various user, item, or contextual factors, catering to a more diverse set of user needs and preferences.

### Code Example: Battling Sparsity with Matrix Factorization

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import lil_matrix
from scipy.sparse.linalg import svds

# User-Item interaction matrix (R)
R = np.array([[4, 0, 2], [0, 5, 0], [3, 0, 0]])

# Convert to sparse matrix
R_sparse = lil_matrix(R)

# Apply Matrix Factorization (SVD)
num_factors = 2
U, sigma, Vt = svds(R_sparse, k=num_factors)

# Reconstruct matrix with reduced dimensions
R_reconstructed = np.dot(np.dot(U, np.diag(sigma)), Vt)

# Predictions for all items
all_user_predicted_ratings = np.dot(np.dot(U, np.diag(sigma)), Vt)

# Top-N recommendations for a user
user_id = 0
user_ratings = all_user_predicted_ratings[user_id]

# Sort the ratings in descending order and get item indices
sorted_indices = np.argsort(-user_ratings)

# Recommend top 2 items that the user has not rated
top_recommended_indices = sorted_indices[~R[user_id].astype(bool)][:2]
```
<br>

## 4. How do _cold start problems_ impact _recommendation systems_ and how can they be _mitigated_?

**Cold start** in the realm of **recommendation systems** arises when the system lacks sufficient data to provide accurate suggestions. It's mainly a problem for new items or users.

### Challenges Posed by Cold Start Problems

1. **User Cold Start**: When a new user interacts with the system, the recommendations are less personalized since their behavior and preferences are unfamiliar.

2. **Item Cold Start**: Also known as the "new item problem," this occurs when a new product or item is added to the system, and there isn't enough historical data to make personalized recommendations.

3. **Data Sparsity**: Even established systems can suffer from data silos, especially within niche categories. This results in a lack of data to effectively predict recommendations for certain items or users.

4. **Demographic Cold Start**: It's difficult to provide personalized recommendations if detailed demographic information about the user is not available.

### Strategies to Tackle Cold Start Problems

#### User and Item Profiles

The system uses available non-interaction data or broad interaction patterns to form initial profiles.

- **Example**: If a user logs in with a social media account, their basic profile might be imported, offering some insights.

#### Context-aware Recommendations

The system uses contextual information, like time, location, or device, to make more relevant suggestions in the absence of detailed historical data.

- **Example**: Suggesting trending or nearby items.

#### Hybrid Recommendations

The system collaborates user-based (utilizes user interaction data) and content-based (relies on item features) techniques to provide more comprehensive recommendations.

- **Example**: For a new user, the system might start with general, content-based recommendations. As they interact more, it tailors suggestions using their behavior.

#### Active Learning

The system strategically selects items to recommend to gain more diverse user interactions, ensuring it doesn't rely on known, popular items.

- **Example**: For new items, the system might show them to a group of users with diverse interests to gauge their potential popularity.

#### Temporal Recommendations

The system considers time as a factor in suggesting content that's naturally time-sensitive, like news or events.

- **Example**: Recommending recently released movies when limited data exists for those movies.

#### User Engagement

The recommendation engine encourages user engagement with the system, enabling it to gather more user preference data.

- **Example**: By using gamification or incentives in interactive applications.

#### Utilizing A/B Testing

Different recommendation strategies are compared to existing strategies to judge user satisfaction and interaction.

- **Example**: Deploy two or more recommendation methods and observe which method yields the best user engagement.

#### Using External Data Sources

Incorporating information from third-party sources can supplement the lack of internal data, especially for new items.

- **Example**: Fetching information from open databases, like movie or books databases.

#### Prompting User Inputs

The system actively seeks feedback from users, especially when it's uncertain about user preferences.

- **Example**: Through simple survey-like interfaces or thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons.

### Code Example: Context-Aware Recommendation

Here is the Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Sample item data
item_data = {
    'item_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'item_name': ['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C', 'Product D', 'Product E'],
    'category': ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Electronics', 'Books', 'Electronics']
}

items = pd.DataFrame(item_data)

# Sample user data with context
user_data = {
    'user_id': [1, 2],
    'state': ['NY', 'CA']
}

users = pd.DataFrame(user_data)

# Sample user interactions
interactions = {
    'user_id': [1, 2, 1],
    'item_id': [4, 1, 2],
    'context': ['Morning', 'Evening', 'Afternoon']
}

interactions_df = pd.DataFrame(interactions)

# Select context for a user (assuming we know the context based on time of the day)
user_id = 1
context = 'Morning'

user_interactions = interactions_df[interactions_df['user_id'] == user_id]
context_specific_interactions = user_interactions[user_interactions['context'] == context]

# Items the user interacted with in the selected context
item_ids_context = context_specific_interactions['item_id'].tolist()

# Match items in the same context
items_in_context = interactions_df[
    (interactions_df['context'] == context) &
    (~interactions_df['item_id'].isin(item_ids_context))
]

recommended_items_context = items_in_context['item_id'].unique()

# Recommend items based on shared context
# but not yet interacted with in the same context
print(recommended_items_context)
```
<br>

## 5. Discuss the importance of _serendipity_, _novelty_, and _diversity_ in _recommendation systems_.

**Recommendation systems**, especially in domains like music, books, and movies, aim to do more than just matchmaking based on **user preferences** and **item relevance**. They strive to foster user engagement through the notions of **serendipity**, **novelty**, and **diversity**.

These characteristics are crucial in countering **filter bubbles** and ensuring that users encounter new and varied content.

### Balance in Recommendations

While it's essential to recommend items closely aligned with a user's preferences, it's equally important to introduce some level of surprise or novelty.

A perfect algorithm might give users exactly what they seek based on their past behaviors, but this risks becoming **redundant** and **predictable**. By introducing some "noise" or diverse elements, the algorithm can pleasantly surprise the user, leading to a more engaging experience.

It's like having dinner at a favorite restaurant. While ordering the usual dish is comforting, discovering a new special can be delightful and create a more memorable experience. This metaphor applies to the viewing, reading, and listening experiences facilitated by recommendation systems.

### Metrics for Evaluation

To ensure that these characteristics are upheld, recommender systems can be evaluated using metrics that reflect serendipity, novelty, and diversity:

- **Novelty**: This evaluates how unique a recommended item is, basically measuring whether it's been recommended before. Algorithms can ensure the freshness of recommendations by tracking the recency of a user's interaction with an item or, in a collaborative filtering context, monitoring when an item was introduced to the system.

- **Serendipity**: This metric highlights a recommendation's unexpectedness. It might stem from attributes such as an item's genre, author, or other metadata that shows diversity from a user's past interactions.

- **Diversity**: This measures the variety or breadth of recommendations. It focuses on ensuring that the recommended items cover a wide range of genres, authors, or categories, rather than being too-focused on a single type.

### Algorithms for Diversity and Novelty

Several algorithms are designed to achieve better diversity and novelty in recommendations:

- **Diversity-Seeking Approaches**: These methods explicitly aim to diversify recommendations. One approach is to cluster items and select a representative from each cluster to guarantee variety.
- **Constrained Recommendations**: By placing constraints on the recommendation process, such as recommending only one item from a particular category, these algorithms promote diversity.
- **Learning from Non-Perfect Data**: Systems that learn from implicit feedback or partial data may naturally introduce diversity, leading to more varied recommendations.
<br>

## 6. How do _matrix factorization techniques_ work in _recommendation engines_?

**Matrix factorization** is a fundamental technique in recommendation systems. At its core, it aims to **decompose the user-item interaction matrix** into two lower-dimensional matrices, thus identifying latent features that capture users' preferences and items' characteristics.

### Intuition

Consider a user-item interaction matrix where each cell represents a user's rating of an item (or its absence). It aims to decompose this matrix into two smaller matrices: one representing user preferences and the other representing item characteristics.

For example, a movie-based recommendation can identify traits like "action," "romance," and "comedy," allowing the system to recommend one or more movies to users who exhibit these latent traits.

Equivalently, in an e-commerce setting, matrix factorization enables the system to extract features such as "price-sensitivity" and "brand loyalty," thus facilitating personalized product recommendations.

### Maths Behind Matrix Factorization

The user-item interaction matrix, $R$, can be factorized into two matrices: a user matrix, $U$, and an item matrix, $I$, such that:

$$
R \approx U \times I^T
$$

The matrices, $U$ and $I$, have reduced dimensions and represent the user preferences and item characteristics, respectively.

The matrix factorization aims to solve the following optimization problem:

$$
\min_{U, I} \sum_{(u,i) \in \Omega} (R_{ui} - U_u \cdot I_i^T)^2 + \lambda\left(\|U\|^2_F + \|I\|^2_F \right)
$$

Here:
- $\Omega$ represents the set of observed user-item interactions.
- The first term is the regular squared-error loss, aiming to minimize the difference between the predicted and observed ratings.
- The second term is a regularization term, incorporating the Frobenius norm to **prevent overfitting**.

The optimization is typically solved using methods such as **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**, **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**, or **non-linear optimization techniques**.

### Metrics for Evaluation

Once the matrices $U$ and $I$ are obtained, predicted recommendations are made using either the dot product (for simple matrix factorization) or combining the decomposed matrices with user or item biases (for enhancements such as in the SVD++ algorithm).

Common metrics for evaluating recommendation systems include **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

### Code Example: Matrix Factorization

Here is the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample user-item interaction matrix
R = np.array([[3, 1, 4, 0],
              [5, 0, 5, 3],
              [2, 1, 1, 4]])

# Set the number of latent features
k = 2

# Initialize random user and item matrices
U = np.random.rand(R.shape[0], k)
I = np.random.rand(R.shape[1], k)

# Perform matrix factorization using gradient descent
learning_rate = 0.001
epochs = 1000
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for u in range(R.shape[0]):
        for i in range(R.shape[1]):
            if R[u, i] > 0:
                e = R[u, i] - np.dot(U[u, :], I[i, :].T)
                U[u, :] += learning_rate * (e * I[i, :])
                I[i, :] += learning_rate * (e * U[u, :])

# Get the approximated user and item matrices
R_approx = np.dot(U, I.T)

print("Original User-Item Matrix:\n", R)
print("Approximated User-Item Matrix:\n", R_approx)
```
<br>

## 7. What are the roles of _user profiles_ and _item profiles_ in a _recommendation system_?

Both **user profiles** and **item profiles** form the foundation of recommendation systems' accuracy and utility. These profiles, often representing users and their preferences and items and their attributes, are derived from historical interaction data between users and items.

### User Profiles

**User profiles** encapsulate the preferences, behaviors, and characteristics of individual users. They form the basis for personalized recommendations, tailoring the suggested items to each user's unique tastes and needs.

Key components of user profiles include:

1. **Explicit Feedback**: Provided through direct actions like ratings or likes.
2. **Implicit Feedback**: Inferred from user behavior, like time spent on an item or the frequency of interaction.
3. **Demographic Data**: Such as age, gender, or location, when available.
4. **Contextual Information**: Pertaining to the current state or environment of the user, such as the device being used or the time of day.
5. **Historical Activity**: Over time, users may evolve in their preferences; the system should adapt accordingly, necessitating the inclusion of past interactions.

### Item Profiles

**Item profiles** capture the attributes and characteristics of the items available for recommendation. These attributes may be intrinsic to the item, observed from user interactions, or sourced externally. Item profiles serve to quantify and contextualize the items available for recommendation, enabling more informed and relevant suggestions to users.

Components of item profiles may include:

1. **Content Features**: Attributes pertaining to the item's content, such as genres for movies or product categories for e-commerce.
2. **Collaborative Signals**: Derived from user-item interactions, such as the popularity of an item or similarity to other items based on user behavior.
3. **Contextual Attributes**: Factors external to the item, such as temporal trends or the user's context during the interaction.
4. **Textual Analysis**: In cases like textual recommendations, item descriptions or associated text data might be leveraged for recommendation.

### Hybrid Systems

While it is common to view user and item profiles as separate entities, some advanced recommendation systems integrate the two. These are called **hybrid systems**. This approach enables a more nuanced understanding of the user-item interaction, often leading to improved recommendation accuracy.

For instance, in systems that utilize content-based and collaborative filtering techniques, user behavior data (collaborative) informs item profiles (content-based) and vice versa, leading to a feedback loop of improved recommendations.

The beauty of machine learning-powered recommendation systems is in their dynamic adaptability. As user and item profiles evolve, the system continuously updates recommendations, striving to provide users with the most appropriate items.
<br>

## 8. Describe the concept of _implicit versus explicit feedback_ in the context of _recommendation systems_.

When it comes to **Recommendation Systems**, a key distinction is made between **explicit** and **implicit** feedback. This classification determines how the system learns from user behaviors.

### Types of Feedback

#### Explicit Feedback

1. **Definition**: This refers to input that is very direct and specific, given consciously by users. Common  examples include ratings (e.g., star ratings on Netflix) or likes/dislikes.
  
2. **Strengths**: Clear, labeled data that is easy to collect and interpret.
  
3. **Weaknesses**: Tends to be sparse as many users don't provide explicit feedback. Subject to biases due to user behavior (e.g., frequent versus rare ratings).

#### Implicit Feedback

1. **Definition**: This encompasses user actions that are not explicitly provided as evaluative data but imply user preferences or behavior. Examples include watch times, clicks, purchases, or dwell times on content.

2. **Strengths**: Passive and abundant data, as most user actions on the platform can be interpreted as implicit feedback. Reduced user burden, as users don't need to actively provide ratings.

3. **Weaknesses**: Lack of clear indication of user preference. No information on the kind of feedback (positive or negative).

### Hybrid Approaches

Both types of feedback have their advantages and limitations. In real-world settings, hybrid methods that combine explicit and implicit feedback are commonly employed to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of user preferences.

#### Netflix Example

- **Explicit**: Users rate movies by giving stars.
- **Implicit**: Netflix tracks which movies users are watching through to the end, which serves as an implicit positive rating.

By leveraging both types of feedback, these systems can offer users more tailored and accurate recommendations.
<br>

## 9. Explain _user-based_ and _item-based collaborative filtering_.

**Collaborative Filtering** is a popular approach in recommendation systems that harnesses user interactions to make personalized suggestions.

In **User-Based** and **Item-Based** CF, distinct methods are used to establish correlations among users and items to predict ratings.

### User-Based CF

Here, the idea is to find users similar to the target user and recommend items that they have liked.

- **Workflow**:
    1. Measure similarity among users.
    2. Select users who are most similar to the target user.
    3. Recommend items highly rated by those selected users, but not yet rated by the target user.

- **Measure of Similarity**:
    Common metrics for user-user similarity include **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** and **Cosine Similarity**.

- **Advantages**:
    - Simplicity in both form and calculation.
    - Intuitiveness: People who are similar tend to like similar items.
    - Decent accuracy especially with ample user-item interaction data and in small to medium-sized systems.

- **Drawbacks**:
    - Sparsity: Even in popular systems, the users' ratings on items may be limited.
    - Displaying a user's profile in real-time to make recommendations can be less practical because of the computational overhead.

### Item-Based CF

In this approach, the strategy is to recommend items similar to those the target user has liked or interacted with.

- **Workflow**:
    1. Compute the similarity between items.
    2. Identify the items the target user has interacted with.
    3. Recommend items similar to those the user has already engaged with.

- **Measure of Similarity**:
    Common metrics for item-item similarity include **Cosine Similarity** and **Adjusted Cosine**. The Adjusted Cosine accounts for the user's average rating.

- **Advantages**:
    - Less affected by **sparsity** compared to user-based CF. This is because item-based recommendations depend on the item's characteristics/similarities, which are usually more stable than the user's preferences.
    - Stability: Recommendations don't change when new users join the system, unlike user-based CF.
    - Practicality: Calculations can be pre-computed, reducing real-time computational demands.

- **Drawbacks**:
    - Constructing an item-item matrix is computationally intensive, especially if the item set is large. This can make **real-time updates** and computations impractical.

#### Code Example: User-User Similarity with Cosine Metric

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Assume `user_rated_matrix` is a matrix with users as rows and items as columns, denoting user ratings.
# Selecting two users, num_users denotes the total number of users.
user1_ratings = user_rated_matrix[0]
user2_ratings = user_rated_matrix[1]

# Computing cosine similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity([user1_ratings, user2_ratings])

print(f"Cosine similarity between user 1 and 2: {similarity[0, 1]}")
```

#### Code Example: Item-Item Similarity with Adjusted Cosine Metric

Here is the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# To calculate similarity, we use the formula: A-Cos(i, j) = Cos(i, j) - (average rating of item i - average rating of item j)
item_ratings = np.array([[5, 4, 4, 3, 0], [0, 3, 5, 4, 3]])

# Calculating the average rating for all items
avg_ratings = np.mean(item_ratings, axis=0)

# Calculating the centered ratings
centered_ratings = item_ratings - avg_ratings

# Compute similarity using centered ratings
similarity = cosine_similarity(centered_ratings.T)

print(f"Adjusted Cosine similarity between item 1 and 2: {similarity[0, 1]}")
```
<br>

## 10. How would you implement a _recommendation system_ using the _k-NN algorithm_?

**k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, a simple yet powerful algorithm, can be adapted to build effective **recommendation systems**.

### Core Principle

The k-NN algorithm predicts the rating a user might give to an item using the actual ratings by similar users. For example, when trying to predict a user's rating for a movie, the algorithm first identifies the $k$ most similar users to the target user (who rated the movie previously). It then averages their ratings for the movie in question, or computes a weighted average based on similarity scores.

### Steps of kNN for Recommendation

1. **Data Collection**: Gather user-item rating data, often in the form of a matrix where rows represent users, columns represent items, and the cells contain ratings.

2. **Similarity Calculation**: Determine the similarity between the target user and all other users. Common metrics include:

    - **Cosine Similarity**:

$$
\text{cosine similarity}(A, B) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are the rating vectors of two users.

 3. **Pearson Correlation**: This metric measures the linear correlation between two users' ratings.

 4. **Nearest Neighbours Identification**: Select the $k$ users most similar to the target user.

 5. **Rating Aggregation**: Combine the ratings of the $k$ users for the item in question to calculate a predicted rating. This can be a simple mean or a weighted mean based on similarity scores.

 6. **Prediction or Recommendation**: The predicted rating can be used to make a direct rating prediction, or for recommendations, items with the highest predicted ratings can be offered.

### Code Example: k-NN for Recommendations

Here is the Python code:

```python
class KNNRecommender:
    def __init__(self, k, metric='cosine', weighted=True):
        self.k = k
        self.metric = metric
        self.weighted = weighted

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.X = X  # User-item matrix
        self.y = y  # Ratings
        return self

    def predict_rating(self, user, item):
        neighbors = self.get_neighbors(user)
        if not neighbors:
            return None
        if self.weighted:

## 11. What is the purpose of using _Alternating Least Squares (ALS)_ in _recommendation systems_?

**Alternating Least Squares** (ALS) is a **matrix factorization** technique commonly used in **collaborative filtering recommendation systems**. It is often preferred over techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) due to its simplicity and efficiency.

### Key Benefits of ALS

1. **Parallelization**: It splits the computation of user and item matrices, making it parallelizable. This is advantageous when working with large datasets.
2. **Implicit Feedback**: ALS can work with implicit, binary feedback (like whether a user interacted with an item or not) in addition to explicit ratings.
3. **Regularization**: ALS has built-in L2 regularization to manage overfitting.
  
### ALS Algorithm

1. **Initialize**: Start with random matrices $U$ and $V$.
2. **Optimize for U**: Keep $V$ fixed and solve for $U$, and then alternate between $U$ and $V$.
3. **Optimize for V**: Keep $U$ fixed and solve for $V$, and then alternate between $U$ and $V$.
4. **Convergence**: The process continues until a stopping criteria is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or when the change in errors becomes negligible.

### Mathematical Formulation

Given a matrix $R$ of user-item ratings, we want to find factors $U$ and $V$ such that their product approximates $R$. The factors are usually of a lower dimension than $R$, which enables us to **model interactions better**.

This is represented by the optimization problem:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctext%7Barg%20min%7D_%7BU%2C%20V%7D%20%5Csum_%7B%28i%2Cj%29%20%5Cin%20%5Ctext%7Bobs%7D%7D%20%28R_%7Bij%7D%20-%20%28UV%5ET%29_%7Bij%7D%29%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Clambda%20%5Cleft%28%20%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20%5Cleft%5ClVert%7BU_%7Bi*%7D%7D%5Cright%5CrVert%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Csum_%7Bj%7D%20%5Cleft%5ClVert%7BV_%7Bj*%7D%7D%5Cright%5CrVert%5E2%20%5Cright%29)

Here:
- $\text{obs}$ represents the set of observed ratings.
- $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter.
- The last term helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large values in the factor matrices.

### Code Example: ALS

Here is the Python code:

```python
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator
from pyspark.ml.recommendation import ALS
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ALSExample").getOrCreate()

# Load data
ratings = spark.read.option("header", "true").option("inferSchema", "true").csv("ratings.csv")

# Drop any rows with missing values
ratings = ratings.dropna()

# Split data into training and test sets
(training, test) = ratings.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])

# Build the recommendation model using ALS on the training data
als = ALS(maxIter=5, regParam=0.01, userCol="userId", itemCol="movieId", ratingCol="rating", coldStartStrategy="drop")

model = als.fit(training)

# Evaluate the model by computing the RMSE on the test data
predictions = model.transform(test)

evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(metricName="rmse", labelCol="rating", predictionCol="prediction")

rmse = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)

print("Root-mean-square error = " + str(rmse))
```

## 12. Can you describe the _Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)_ and its role in _recommendations_?

**Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** is a fundamental matrix factorization technique frequently used in recommender systems. Its role is particularly prominent in the "**Model-Based Methods**" category (as opposed to collaborative filtering), which also includes techniques like **Matrix Factorization**.

### The Science Behind SVD

Both matrices, $U$ and $V$, have orthonormal columns. These two matrices, in principal component  {N} (k)  analysis for instance, are used to rotate the data. The diagonal matrix, $\Sigma$, contains singular values. These express the variance captured by the principal components. For which $k$ is it ideal to rotate this dataset?

### Choosing the Right SVD Matrix Size

The **percentage of variance explained** can inform the choice of $k$. This allows for a trade-off between model complexity and its ability to represent the data. One common method is to choose $k$ such that a **certain percentage of variance** is captured, like 95%.

### Mathematical Calculation of $k$

1. Compute **total** sum of squares (TSS):

$$
TSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2
$$

2. Calculate **$k$ required** using the ratio of variance explained to the total variance:

$$
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i^2}{TSS} \geq 0.95
$$

## 13. Explain the concept of a _recommendation system_ using _association rule mining_.

**Association rule mining** directly supports recommendation systems by identifying relationships among items in a dataset.

### Association Rule Mining: Key Metrics

- **Support**: The frequency of an itemset in the dataset.
- **Confidence**: Probability of one item's occurrence given the occurrence of another in the same transaction.
- **Lift**: Indicates whether the two items in a rule are dependent or independent of one another. When lift is greater than 1, it suggests that purchasing one product will increase the likelihood of purchasing another product.

### Example: Supermarket Shopping

- **Support**: Percentage of customers who bought both items.
- **Confidence**: Probability that a customer who bought the first item will also buy the second.
- **Lift**: Shows the percentage increase in the sale of the second item when the first is bought.

### Application in E-commerce

For online retail, association rules could, for instance, suggest that customers who buy a certain type of camera are also likely to buy particular accessories. This insight can then feed into targeted marketing strategies.

### Code Example: Applying Association Rules

Here is the Python code:

```python
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules
import pandas as pd

# Construct the dataset
dataset = {'Camera': [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], 'Tripod': [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], 'Case': [1, 0, 0, 1, 1], 'Lens': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}
df = pd.DataFrame(dataset)
df = df.astype(bool)

# Mine association rules
frequent_itemsets = apriori(df, min_support=0.6, use_colnames=True)
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1)
print(rules)
```

## 14. What is a _hybrid recommendation system_ and when would you use it?

A **Hybrid Recommendation System** effectively combines the strengths of collaborative and content-based filtering methods. It provides balanced and often more accurate recommendations than using one methodology alone. It is useful when neither collaborative nor content-based methods suffice individually, and when business needs evolve over time.

### When to Use a Hybrid Recommendation System

- **Sparse Data**: Hybrid methods can be exceptionally useful when dealing with sparse datasets, where traditional collaborative filtering might struggle due to limited user-item interactions.

- **Cold Start Problem**: Hybrid models can help mitigate the cold start problem for new users or items, which can be a challenge for both collaborative and content-based systems on their own.

- **Diverse Content**: Interactive platforms such as film and music networks benefit from the fusion of user feedback and item attributes. It helps in recommending niche items that might not have received much user feedback.

- **Dynamic Business Needs**: As business priorities and data landscapes evolve, hybrid models can adapt more flexibly than single-method systems.

- **Contrasting User Preferences**: For apps or websites catering to a mixed user base with varying preferences, hybrid models better capture this diversity and can make more balanced recommendations.

- **Global vs Local Patterns**: Collaborative and content-based models tend to focus, respectively, on overall user preferences and specific item traits. A hybrid approach strikes a balance to reflect both global and local patterns.

### Types of Hybrid Recommendation Systems

#### Weighted Hybrid
- **Approach**: Requires pre-determined weights based on methods' historical performances.
- **Use-Case**: Valuable for domains where one method consistently outperforms the other.

#### Switching Hybrid
- **Approach**: Dynamically selects the best-performing method for specific recommendation scenarios.
- **Use-Case**: Effective when either method, collaborative or content-based, might be more suitable under certain circumstances.

#### Feature Combination
- **Approach**: Uses the amalgamation of collaborative and content-based features, often through techniques like **matrix factorization** that involves latent features.
- **Use-Case**: Powerful for domains like e-commerce where multiple types of item features, as well as user-item interactions, are pertinent.

#### Cascade Hybrid
- **Approach**: One method's outputs are used to refine the results of the other method.
- **Use-Case**: Applicable in sequential recommendation scenarios, such as news articles or videos, where the user engages with items in a specific order.

#### Ensemble Hybrid
- **Approach**: Operates multiple recommendation algorithms separately and combines their outputs using techniques like averaging or voting.
- **Use-Case**: Reliable in domains where no individual algorithm excels and an amalgamation of successful techniques is desired.

## 15. Describe the use of _deep learning_ in _recommendation systems_.

**Deep learning** techniques have revitalized **recommendation systems** by addressing specific challenges like **cold-starts** and intricate data representations. 

Let's explore the advantages and unique functions of deep learning in recommendation systems.

### Strengths of Deep Learning in Recommendation Systems

- **Improved Latent Representations**: Models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and AutoRec learn meaningful **latent features** or embeddings.
  
- **Complex Pattern Recognition**: Deep systems can detect intricate patterns and non-linear relationships in data.

- **Flexibility**: These models can handle various types of data, including images, audio, and text, besides traditional structured data.

- **Scalability**: Using modern hardware like GPUs and TPUs, **deep learning models** can manage vast amounts of data and are highly parallelizable.

- **Hybrid Models**: Combine the best of both collaborative and content-based techniques using deep learning.

- **Cold-start Handling**: Deep models are often robust in dealing with both new users and items, alleviating cold-start issues.

- **Temporal Dynamics**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and other recurrent architectures are tailored for sequential data, tracking changes over time.

- **Interpretable and Explainable Recommendations**: Techniques like attention mechanisms and embeddings can provide insights into system decisions, critical for certain domains such as healthcare.

### Commonly Used Deep Learning Models

#### Collaborative Filtering

- **Autoencoders**: These compress high-dimensional rating matrices into low-dimensional latent representations, capturing user-item interactions.

- **Matrix Factorization**: Simplifies the user-item matrix by breaking it down into lower-dimensional matrices, characterizing users and items with latent factors.

#### Content-Based Filtering

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Effective for processing visual or sequential data, they identify patterns attentive to local structures.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Tailored to sequential data like time-stamped user-item interactions or textual descriptions.

In complex domains like entertainment or e-commerce, hybrid systems marrying collaborative and content-based methodologies along with deep learning can demonstrate superior recommendation performance.
